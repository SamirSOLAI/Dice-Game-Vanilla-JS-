Dice Game — JavaScript 
📌 Overview

This project is a classic Dice Game built with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Two players take turns rolling a dice, accumulating points in a current round score. They can choose to “Hold” to add their current score to their total — but if they roll a 1, they lose their current points and the turn switches.

The first player to reach 50 points wins the game.
